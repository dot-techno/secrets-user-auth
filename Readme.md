## Secrets
An app with user registration and login to access and post secrets.

Users can use local auth, or google authentication using oauth 2.0.

This is a simple version of the whisper app, where anyone can see secrets submitted without any user identifying information. Authentication is used to submit new secrets.

Tech stack used:
 - Node.js
 - EJS
 - Express
 - Passort for authentication
 - MongoDB and Mongoose

### The goal is to explore different authentication options.

v1 has no auth
v2 uses encrpytion with a secret key to encript the MongoDB records
v3 has auth using local database and bcyrpt to salt and store password hashes
v4 has local authentication using Passport.js
v5 has local and Google oauth 2.0 autentication using Passport.js
